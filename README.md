**Why this is here**

I found an amazing list  of guides for creating online games using HTML. They are rather small and simple games, but I feel they are a great place to begin learning. I wish to enhance my coding skills by following these tutorials, and by working through and fully understanding the videos I wish to alter or build off the tutorials and make the games truly my own. 

**What I wish to do**

Once I understand the underlying concepts, perhaps I can make my own without a guide! Once I've completed the tutorials I will also try to change the game's original pixel art which should be another fun practice allowing me to give the games my own preferred aesthetic

If you are interested in game development or wish to see the source, I highly recommend checking the source that inspired me to start this process, I think I have 50 games to go, Here is the link to his sources!
