I found a cool list of guides for making games online on HTML,

I wish to improve my coding so I'm going to follow the videos and see what I can make,

After completion, I will understand the ideas behind the games fully and either rewrite them or add on to them to make them my own

I also wish to make pixel art for the games

Here is the link to the original creation whose guides I followed, I highly recommend them
